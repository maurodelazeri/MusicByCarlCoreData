# MusicByCarlCoreData
An iOS music player whose media items are stored in a Core Data database
The user interface is similar to the native iOS 6 music player.  To begin using the app, the user selects the Database option on the More tab and presses the Build Database button.  The database is created from all the music entries in the user's iTunes music library.  Once the database is created, all the other features in the app are available.
